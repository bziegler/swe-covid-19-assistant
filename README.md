# swe-covid-19-assistant

Flask app that uses Google's Universal Sentence Encoder to encode sentences in 16 different languages. 

These encodings are used to find the most similar questions from a database of questions provided by the Swedish Public Healthy Agency (https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/fragor-och-svar/). 

The aim of this project is to promote access to important COVID-19 recommendations in multiple languages that reflect Sweden's linguistic diversity.
